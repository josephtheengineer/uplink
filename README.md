# Uplink
A sandbox made using the Godot Game Engine.

## Setup
This project uses a [seperate repo](https://github.com/josephtheengineer/edenuniversebuilder-assets) to host the asset files. This is to ensure the project is quick and easy to clone. This seperate repo should be placed in the root of the project like so:

```
uplink
├── assets
│   ├── fonts
│   ├── models
│   ├── sounds
│   └── textures
├── info
├── scenes
└── scripts
    ├── features
    └── systems
```
